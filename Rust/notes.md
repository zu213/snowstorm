 # Rust
 For Rust I didn't use GDI, instead I used minifb(mini framebuffer) this allowed me to keep the code extremely minimal to create the window. This felt appropriate as Rust is a relatively high level language within this repo. However, this also allowed me a lot of control making Rust my choie for coding this simple snow animation.

 Compile with: `cargo run`
