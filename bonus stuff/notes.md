 # TBC Snow languages

 I have left one languages undeveloped

 ### Fortran
 Fortran proposed more difficulty as the x86_64 .exe didnt seem to be installable via MSYS MinGW_64 which is what I used to obtain the other languages in this repo. This made linking libraries difficult as I am on a 64 bit system, therefore, I decided to leave this one for later development.

 Compiled with: `gfortran hello_world.f90 -o hello_world.exe`
